All notable changes to this project are documented here.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.2] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- **Claude Code plugin marketplace.** The repo is now also a Claude Code plugin
  marketplace, so users can `/plugin marketplace add helderpgoncalves/apple-stocks-mcp`
  and `/plugin install apple-stocks-mcp@apple-stocks` instead of configuring the
  MCP server by hand (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`,
  `.mcp.json`).
- Repository governance: `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, issue
  and PR templates, Dependabot, and a tag-triggered release workflow.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- `mcpName` field and `server.json` so the server can be published to the
  official [MCP Registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io)
  (`io.github.helderpgoncalves/apple-stocks-mcp`).
- Richer README: animated demo GIF, badges, example outputs, per-tool field
  table, and a FAQ / troubleshooting section.

### Changed

- Reworked the documentation around privacy and legal clarity (trademark /
  nominative use, "your own data on your own Mac", not-financial-advice,
  warranty disclaimer).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- `stock_details` — fundamentals: day & 52-week range, market cap, volume &
  average volume, P/E, EPS, beta, dividend yield, next earnings date.
- `stock_chart` — cached intraday OHLCV chart rendered as an ASCII sparkline.
- `portfolio_summary` and `top_movers` — whole-watchlist analytics.
- `search_watchlist` — match the watchlist by symbol or company name.
- `stocks_doctor` — environment diagnostics (macOS, data presence, readability,
  Full Disk Access).
- MCP **resources** (`stocks://watchlist`, `stocks://quotes`) and **prompts**
  (`analyze_portfolio`, `research_stock`).
- Test suite (Node test runner) against synthetic fixtures, and GitHub Actions
  CI on Linux / Node 18, 20, 22.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- Initial release: a macOS-only MCP server that reads the pre-installed Apple
  Stocks app's local data.
- Tools: `list_watchlist`, `get_quote`, `quote_watchlist`, `apple_stock`,
  `add_stock` (opens the Stocks app via the `stocks://` URL scheme).
